## 📌 Project Overview
IMPORTING LIBRARIES



EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Data Quality: Handling Duplicate Data

Handling Unique Data

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `final_file.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies (to be created if not already present).

## 🚀 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Implementation of machine learning/deep learning models.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics.
- Visualization of datasets, results, and comparisons.
- Well-structured workflow for reproducibility.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
